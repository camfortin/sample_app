<h1>Cascade Falls Mushroom Hunt</h1>

<p>I went on a fantastic loop from cascade falls to the fire station on pantoll and back down on another small trail. perfection with mushrooms and waterfalls everywhere.</p>

<p>I ended up finding more mushrooms than anticipated, and I wish I had brought some home with me as soon as I got home and realized a few were choice edibles (candy caps and hedgehog mushrooms). I also found a few tiny "earpick" mushrooms growing out of a douglas fir cone, they are the solitary species of their genus and have incredible looking spore spikes hanging down from their kidney shaped caps.</p>
